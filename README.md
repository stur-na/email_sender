I recently started OOP in python and was introduced to class and its various components, also learning learning to visualise code as object is quite daunting
at first but i realized as i'm learning python classes and methods, it gives me a better understanding of how most of the modules in python are structured.
So here is a simple script to send an email message in python using MIME
this script also shows how to add an attachment as part of the email message
the packages imported are smtplib,
encoders from the email library
MIMEText, MIMEBase and MIMEMultipart from the email.mime class all in the same email library.
